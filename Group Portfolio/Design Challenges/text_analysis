[Design Brief]
It is considered that some speakers, and in particular, some politicians, 
are more self-centred than others.  Design a program that can read in the 
speeches of two different people and count the instances of the words “I”, 
“me”, “mine”, “us” and “we”, “our”. The program should output a count of the 
instances of each of the words and then state which of the two speakers is the 
more self-centred.


[Pseudocode]
speech1 = input(Please enter the first speech you would like to analyse)
speech2 = input(Please enter the second speech you would like to analyse)

scanSpeech(speech1)
scanSpeech(speech2)

output "Speaker one used 'i' " & speech1.iCount & " times."
output "Speaker one used 'me' " & speech1.meCount & " times."
output "Speaker one used 'mine' " & speech1.mineCount & " times."
output "Speaker one used 'us' " & speech1.usCount & " times."
output "Speaker one used 'we' " & speech1.weCount & " times."
output "Speaker one used 'our' " & speech1.ourCount & " times."
output "Speaker two used 'i' " & speech2.iCount & " times."
output "Speaker two used 'me' " & speech2.meCount & " times."
output "Speaker two used 'mine' " & speech2.mineCount & " times."
output "Speaker two used 'us' " & speech2.usCount & " times."
output "Speaker two used 'we' " & speech2.weCount & " times."
output "Speaker two used 'our' " & speech2.ourCount & " times."

speaker1Score = speech1.iCount + speech1.meCount + speech1.mineCount + speech1.usCount + speech1.weCount + speech1.ourCount

speaker2Score = speech2.iCount + speech2.meCount + speech2.mineCount + speech2.usCount + weCount + ourCount



Function scanString(string, phrase, count)
    for every phrase in string
        output = output + 1
    loop

Procedure scanSpeech (speech)
    speech.iCount = integer
    speech.meCount = integer
    speech.mineCount = integer
    speech.usCount = integer
    speech.weCount = integer
    speech.ourCount = integer

    scanString(speech, "i", iCount)
    scanString(speech, "me", meCount)
    scanString(speech, "mine", mineCount)
    scanString(speech, "us", usCount)
    scanString(speech, "we", weCount)
    scanString(speech, "our", ourCount)

    

[Testing]
    
Test data:
    Test data is mostly or wholly complete. There is evidence of having traced the design for most/all of the test cases. 

[Commentary]
    Thoughtful reflection on all of the process, including improvements for the future.
