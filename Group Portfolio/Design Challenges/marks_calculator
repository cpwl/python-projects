[Design Brief]
It is considered that some speakers, and in particular, some politicians,
are more self-centred than others.  Design a program that can read in the
speeches of two different people and count the instances of the words “I”,
“me”, “mine”, “us” and “we”, “our”. The program should output a count of the
instances of each of the words and then state which of the two speakers is the more self-centred.



[Pseudocode]
Function validateInput(userInput)
if userInput is an integer
    if userInput is between 0 and 100
        Return True
    else
        output "Please enter a valid input."
        Return False
endif


validInput = False
while validInput = False
    userInput = input("Please enter your score for the group portfolio: ")
    validInput = validateInput(userInput)
end while
groupPortfolioScore = userInput

while validInput = False
    validInput = False
    userInput = input("Please enter your score for the first in-class programming challenge: ")
    validInput = validateInput(userInput)
end while
challenge1Score = userInput

while validInput = False
    validInput = False
    userInput = input("Please enter your score for the second in-class programming challenge: ")
    validInput = validateInput(userInput)
end while
challenge2Score = userInput

moduleMark = groupPortfolioScore + challenge1Score + challenge2Score
moduleMark = moduleMark / 3


if moduleMark >= 40 then
    output "You have passed the module!"
else if moduleMark < 40 then
    output "You have failed the module!"
endif


[Testing]
Test data:
    "36, 30, 25" - Expected outcome: pass the validation, fail the module

    "50, 64, 85" - Expected outcome: pass the validation, pass the module

    "110" - Expected outcome: fail the validation

    "50.5" - Expected outcome: fail the validation

    "seventy five percent" - Expected outcome: fail the validation


[Commentary]
> We chose to use a user function validateInput() to validate each input as it is a repeated procedure.
> To scale this design further we would need to ask the user to input the structure of the module marking scheme, then use that input
