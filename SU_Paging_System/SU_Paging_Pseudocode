Display a menu
    Display a menu title
    Display all staff members currently on shift at the top of the menu (by staffID)
    Display the staffID of any staff currently being paged

    1: Allow staff members to page other staff members
        - Show a menu of available staff members (by staffID)
        - When a staffID is selected, send an output to page that staff member
        - Return to the main menu, this time displaying the paged staffID at the top

    2: Allow staff members to log into the till
        - Take the staffID 
        - Validate the staffID against a list of staff members that are clocked in
        - If the staff member is currently being paged, cancel the page
        - Set the specified member of staff to be unavailable for paging (as they are now at the bar)

    3: Allow staff members to log out of the till
        - Take the staffID
        - Validate the staffID against a list of staff members that are clocked in
        - Set the specified member of staff to be unavailable for paging (as they are already at the bar)

    4: Allow staff members to clock in to their shift
        - Take the staffID
        - Set the staff member as available to be paged

    5: Allow staff members to clock out of their shift
        - Take the staffID
        - Remove the staffID from the list of staff on shift

    6: Quit the program
